# Extension Resources

## Icon

The extension icon (`icon.png`) should be:
- Size: 128x128 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Design: Represents workflow/automation (e.g., connected nodes, flowchart elements)
- Colors: Professional, matches Claude branding if applicable

### Icon Placeholder

Currently using a placeholder. To add a custom icon:

1. Create a 128x128 PNG image
2. Save as `resources/icon.png`
3. The `package.json` is already configured to use it

### Design Suggestions

- Visual workflow representation (nodes connected with arrows)
- Gear/cog with network connections
- Flow diagram icon
- Claude logo integrated with workflow elements

**Note**: Actual icon file needs to be created by a designer or using design tools.
